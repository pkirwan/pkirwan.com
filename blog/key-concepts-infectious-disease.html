          <h4>Key takeaways</h4>
          <p>This post explains some fundamental concepts in infectious disease research, including how we measure
            disease spread and severity:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How we track how many people acquire an infection (incidence) and how many people have the infection at
              one time (prevalence) </li>
            <li>What the "$R$ number" tells us about disease spread</li>
            <li>Different methods to assess the impact of disease when we don't have perfect data</li>
            <li>Challenges in measuring the true burden of infectious diseases</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 id="epidemiological-measures">Epidemiological measures</h3>

        <p>Epidemiology is the study and analysis of patterns of diseases and determinants of health in
          a population. In the context of infectious diseases, epidemiologists and statisticians employ
          several standard measures of disease burden to assess the impact of a disease, and to guide the
          appropriate public health response. These measures include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>the <strong>incidence of infection</strong>, defined as the rate of new infections occurring over a
            specific period of time, e.g. new cases per 1,000 people per year;</li>
          <li>the <strong>prevalence of infection</strong>, defined as the proportion of the population that have the
            disease at a specific point in time, regardless of when they became infected;</li>
          <li>for diseases with adverse outcomes, the <strong>mortality associated with infection</strong>, defined as
            the incidence of death from the disease.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="r-number">The $R$ number</h4>

        <p>A key measure of the spread of a disease, related to the incidence of infection, is the basic
          reproduction number, denoted $R_0$. The $R_0$ value measures the expected number of cases directly
          generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.</p>

        <p>For instance, if $R_0 = 3$ for a particular disease then one infected individual
          will, on average, infect three others. When $R_0 > 1$ an infection will spread in a population,
          whereas when $R_0 > 1$ the infection will eventually die out.</p>

        <p>Importantly, not every individual within a population will be equally susceptible to infection.
          Immunity to a pathogen might be acquired through vaccination or recovery from previous
          infection, both of which can provide a level of protection against future infections. Through
          widespread vaccination, immunity can be conferred to a large portion of a population, reducing
          susceptibility and thereby decreasing $R_0$.</p>

        <h3 id="estimating-burden">Estimating the burden of infectious disease</h3>
        <p>To understand how quickly a virus is spreading through a population, and the corresponding burden of disease,
          timely and robust estimates are required. The incidence of new cases, prevalence
          of undiagnosed infection, and extent of disease severity can all inform policy makers seeking to implement
          effective and appropriate public health measures.</p>

        <h4 id="incidence-and-prevalence">Incidence and prevalence</h4>

        <div class="figure">
          <img src="../images/incidence-prevalence.png"
            alt="Diagram comparing incidence (new cases over time) and prevalence (total cases at a point in time)" />
          <p class="caption">Figure 1: An example of the prevalence and incidence of HIV in the US over time. Incidence
            measures new cases over time, while prevalence measures total active cases at a specific point. Figure from:
            Steward K.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Incidence of infection and the prevalence of an infectious disease in a population are generally unobserved,
          with observable information restricted to test outcomes among subsets of a population. Testing processes may
          themselves be influenced by unobserved parameters, such as an individual's propensity to test, and the time
          from infection to symptom presentation (if symptoms present at all).</p>

        <p>To reconstruct the incidence and prevalence of infection from the available testing data, statistical and
          mathematical modelling techniques which adjust for sampling biases are employed. These techniques combine
          information from a range of sources to make valid statistical inference about unobserved incidence and
          prevalence.</p>

        <h4 id="severity">Severity</h4>

        <p>Two common metrics used to understand the severity of infectious diseases and the factors associated with
          adverse
          outcomes are the infection fatality risk (IFR) and case fatality risk (CFR):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Infection Fatality Risk (IFR)</strong>: The percentage of <em>all infected people</em> who die
            from the disease (including those whose infections were never detected)</li>
          <li><strong>Case Fatality Rate (CFR)</strong>: The percentage of <em>confirmed cases</em> who die from the
            disease</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Since infections resulting in death are more likely to be recorded, and mild infections (particularly
          asymptomatic infections) less likely to be recorded, the CFR will almost always be higher than the IFR.
          Statistical modelling can be used to relate these measures of severity to underlying characteristics collected
          through case-surveillance data. </p>

        <h4 id="effectiveness-of-interventions">Effectiveness of interventions</h4>

        <p>Monitoring outcomes among a target group after the introduction of a public health intervention allows for
          the real-world effectiveness of the intervention to be assessed, and changes over time to be detected. For
          example, effectiveness estimates might consider reductions in the transmission or acquisition of an infection
          among a treated group compared to an untreated group. Making these estimates requires reliable testing data,
          recognition of potential biases, and methodologies which can account for these
          biases.</p>

        <h4 id="challenges-in-estimating">Challenges in estimating infectious disease burden</h4>

        <p>The majority of the data available for infectious disease monitoring relies on observational data, where a
          population is followed without actively intervening on an exposure in a randomised
          way. As a result, estimates of infectious disease burden are often considerably
          complicated by selection bias, which arises when the selected population observed is different from the
          general population of interest.</p>

        <div class="figure">
          <img src="../images/biases.webp"
            alt="Diagram comparing incidence (new cases over time) and prevalence (total cases at a point in time)" />
          <p class="caption">Figure 2: Schematic showing recruitment-based biases in a hypothetical serosurvey. Figure
            from: Accorsi et al.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Common causes of selection bias in observational data include: testing policies (which may vary nationally
          and sub-nationally), individual health-seeking behaviour, test availability, clinician decision-making, and
          detection rates of different tests. Inaccuracies in the available case-surveillance
          data may also arise: at data input, due to incomplete/inaccurate reporting or misdiagnosis; and at data
          collection, due to insufficient surveillance infrastructure and data processing methods.</p>

        <p>Unless these potential sources of bias are well-understood and accounted for they can affect the validity of
          estimates. For example, the IFR measure of severity requires complete knowledge
          of both the number of infections and number of deaths. Particularly in the early stages of a pandemic, when
          testing is either unavailable or sub-optimal, these quantities may be impossible to measure. The CFR is more
          straightforward to assess, since confirmed infections are more likely to be recorded, but this measure is
          highly sensitive to testing practices. This was particularly the case during the initial wave of the COVID-19
          pandemic, when biases in case-surveillance led to wide variability in national estimates of the case-fatality
          rate, from 0.1% to over 25%.</p>

        <p>Even when knowledge of these multi-faceted biases is available, statistical methodologies must be carefully
          chosen to properly control for the biases.</p>
