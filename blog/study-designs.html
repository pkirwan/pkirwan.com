          <h4>Key takeaways</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Different observational study designs (cross-sectional, case-control, cohort) are suited to different
              research questions and data collection scenarios</li>
            <li>Cross-sectional studies provide snapshots of prevalence at a single time point, while cohort studies
              follow exposure groups over time</li>
            <li>Case-control studies compare past exposures between those with and without outcomes, using odds ratios
              to measure associations</li>
            <li>Three main types of bias affect observational studies: information bias (measurement errors), collider
              bias (selection effects), and confounding (unmeasured common causes)</li>
            <li>Epidemic phase bias is specific to infectious disease studies with time-varying incidence and rapid
              symptom onset</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>In this final post of this series I describe a number of observational study designs and several potential
          sources of bias common to these studies.</p>

        <p>Observational studies are common in epidemiology and a valuable resource for understanding infectious disease
          burden. Several different types of observational study design exist, which may be more or less suitable
          depending on the research question, the need to control for specific biases, and the feasibility of data
          collection.</p>

          studies and to inform the calculation of standard statistical measures.</p>

        <p class="caption">Table 1: A $2 \times 2$ table of outcomes and exposures.</p>

        <h4 id="cross-sectional-studies">Cross-sectional studies</h4>

        <p>Cross-sectional studies may be used to assess:</p>

        <ul>
          <li> the <em>prevalence of an outcome</em>, defined as: $(A+C)/(A+B+C+D)$</li>
          <li> the <em>prevalence of various different exposures</em>, defined as: $(A+B)/(A+B+C+D)$</li>
        </ul>

        <p>within a
          population. They provide a snapshot of the population at a single point in time and can be relatively
          straightforward to conduct using surveillance data.</p>

        <h4 id="case-control-studies">Case-control studies</h4>

        <p>Case-control studies are used to investigate the effects of specific exposures on an outcome. In these
          studies
          the outcome of interest has already occurred, individuals who have experienced the outcome are termed "cases",
          and are compared to individuals without the outcome, known as "controls". The odds of being exposed are
          compared in cases vs. controls via the <em>odds ratio</em>:
          $$\frac{AD}{BC}$$
        </p>

        <h4 id="test-negative-case-control-studies">Test-negative case-control studies</h4>

        <p>Test-negative case-control studies are a sub-type of case-control study. These studies aim to minimise bias
          specifically as a result of test-seeking behaviour by selecting only individuals who test for a disease. As
          for
          case-control studies, the cases are individuals who test positive, controls are those who test negative, and
          again the odds of being exposed are compared between cases and controls.</p>

        <h4 id="cohort-studies">Cohort studies</h4>

        <p>In cohort studies participants are selected based on their exposure status and followed up over time. The
          incidence of the outcome of interest is compared between individuals with and without the exposure using the
          <em>relative risk</em>:

          $$
          \frac{A/(A+B)}{C/(C+D)}
          $$
        </p>
        <!-- 
          For further discussion of test-negative case-control and cohort study designs, see
          Section~\ref{sec:cohort-study-design}. -->

        <h3 id="biases-in-observational-studies">Biases in observational studies</h3>

        <p>Bias can be defined as: <em>any process at any stage of inference which tends to produce results or
            conclusions that differ systematically from the truth</em>. All of the observational study designs
          described above can include potential sources of bias, which are often grouped into three broad types:
          information bias, collider bias, and confounding.</p>

        <h4 id="information-bias">Information bias</h4>

        <p>Information, or measurement, bias arises due to inaccuracies in data and may be induced by errors or missing
          information in either the outcome or exposure variables, for example, incorrect coding of a
          diagnosis. Information bias can be mitigated through careful study design and data
          collection mechanisms, these could include: double entry of data, and linking information across different
          systems for validation.</p>

        <h4 id="collider-bias">Collider bias</h4>

        <p>Collider bias, or selection bias, occurs when individuals are selected into an analysis by conditioning on
          a common "collider" variable (a variable which is influenced by two other variables).
          Figure 2 shows an example of collider bias: people who are regular smokers and people
          at high risk of severe COVID-19 illness are both more likely to be admitted to hospital. By conditioning on
          hospitalisation a distorted association between smoking and COVID-19 mortality could be induced, and this
          bias may occur in either a positive or negative direction. For example: a negative association between
          smoking and COVID-19 severity was reported by more than one early risk-factor study for COVID-19, with a
          review concluding this result may have been a result of collider bias.</p>

          <p class="caption">Figure 2: Causal diagram showing the effect of collider
            bias, where conditioning on hospitalisation induces a distorted association between smoking and COVID-19
            severity. Conditioned on variables have bounding boxes, distorted associations are shown as dashed
            lines.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Collider bias is most easily avoided by not conditioning on the collider, but this may be impractical
          depending
          on the nature of data collection. In the context of
          COVID-19, Griffith et al. have suggested several methods for assessing the sensitivity of model results to
          collider bias, such as inverse probability weighting. Where information is available, the extent of the bias
          can also be examined by comparing the profile of selected individuals to the wider population of interest,
          e.g. whether hospitalised individuals tend to be older or more likely to have comorbidities as compared to
          the general population.</p>

        <h4 id="confounding">Confounding</h4>

        <p>Confounding is related to collider bias, but occurs by not conditioning on an explanatory variable. As a
          result
          confounding is sometimes termed <em>latent variable</em> bias. Confounding introduces a "backdoor path", an
          additional
          source of association between the explanatory variable and the outcome, so the measured association cannot be
          interpreted as a causal effect.</p>

        <p>An example of confounding is shown in the causal diagram in Figure 3: during vaccine roll-out older people
          were more likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, but also more likely to experience
          severe COVID-19. If age group is not adjusted for then a distorted association between vaccination and
          COVID-19 severity may be induced. Confounding can be avoided by ensuring that factors that might be associated
          with the outcome are measured and adjusted for.</p>

        <h4 id="epidemic-phase-bias">Epidemic phase bias</h4>

        <p>Epidemic phase bias occurs in studies with time-varying incidence of infection. This bias is induced by a
          relationship between the time from infection to symptom onset and an individual's eventual outcome, e.g.
          those who go on to die may experience a more rapid onset of symptoms following infection, an average of $c$
          days sooner. Since estimates must be conditioned on the observed symptom onset date, rather than the
          unobserved infection date, this relationship can introduce bias into results when an epidemic is in a mode of
          growth or decline.</p>

        <p>Epidemic phase bias is corrected by "shifting" the symptom onset date among those who experience the more
          severe
          outcome to be $c$ days later, so that the time from infection to symptom onset is uncorrelated with the
          outcome
          (the time-to-event of interest remains the same for both outcomes.) As the true value of $c$ is typically
          unknown, sensitivity analysis with differing values of $c$ can be used to assess the susceptibility of
          results
          to this bias.</p>
