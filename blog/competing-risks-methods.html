        <h3 id="competing-risks">Competing risks</h3>

        <p>In medical cohort studies, multiple study end-points are common (e.g. death, intensive care admission, and
          discharge). These multiple end-points are known as <em>competing risks</em> and may hinder the event of
          interest, or modify the chance that this event occurs. Kaplan-Meier and Cox
          proportional hazards models treat competing risks as censored observations, and do not account for
          dependencies between events. Hence the assumption of independent times-to-events in these conventional
          survival analyses is violated in the presence of competing risks.</p>

        <div class="figure">
          <img src="../images/competing-risks.png" alt="An example of competing risks in survival data" />
          <p class="caption">Figure 1: Example of competing risks (death, discharge, and intensive care
            (ICU) admission) in hospital survival data.</p>
        </div>

        <p>To correctly address competing risks, "competing risks survival models" are available. In these models an
          individual is observed over time, with several possible events 'competing' until one takes place and the
          individual transitions to the corresponding state. Importantly there is no
          assumption of independence for the distribution of the time to competing events and censoring can still be
          appropriately accounted for.</p>

        <h3 id="cause-specific-functions">Cause-specific survival functions</h3>
        <p>
          We'll start by defining the cause-specific hazard and cause-specific cumulative incidence
          functions, which are the key components of competing risks survival analysis.
        </p>

        <h4 id="cause-specific-hazards">Cause-specific hazard function</h4>

        <p>Let $T$ be a random variable for the survival time and $C$ be a random variable for the cause of failure. The
          <em>cause-specific</em> hazard function for the $j$th cause, $j = \{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$ is defined by:
        </p>

        <p>$$h_j(t) = \lim_{\delta t \downarrow 0} \frac{\Pr(t \leq T < t + \delta t, C=j \mid T \geq t)}{\delta t}
            $$</p>

            <p>Defining $f_j(t)$ as the <em>cause-specific</em> density function, and $S(t)=\Pr(T \geq t)$ as the
              overall survivor function, the relationship shown in <a href="survival-analysis.html#hazard-function">part
                II of this series</a> still holds in the presence of competing risks:</p>

            <p>$$h_j(t)=\frac{f_j(t)}{S(t)}$$</p>


            <h4 id="cause-specific-cumulative-incidence">Cause-specific cumulative incidence</h4>

            <p>The <em>cause-specific</em> cumulative incidence function, i.e. the probability of surviving until time
              $t$ and failure from cause $j$, in the presence of all other risks, is given by:</p>

            <p>$$F_j(t) = \Pr(T < t, C=j)$$</p>

                <p>for $j=\{1, 2, \dots, m\}$, with $\Pr(C=j)$ often written as $\pi_j$. An
                  expression for $F_j(t)$ in terms of the cause-specific hazard function may be derived using the
                  equation above:</p>

                <p>$$\begin{aligned}
                  h_j(t) &=\frac{f_j(t)}{S(t)} \\
                  f_j(t) &=S(t)h_j(t) \\
                  F_j(t) &=\int_0^t S(u)h_j(u) du
                  \end{aligned}$$</p>

                <h3 id="aalen-johansen">Aalen-Johansen estimator</h3>

                <p>The standard non-parametric estimator of the cause-specific incidence function is the Aalen-Johansen
                  estimator, also described as the 'multi-state version' of the Kaplan-Meier
                  estimator.</p>

                <p>Firstly, by the non-parametric Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cause-specific hazard function for cause
                  $j$:</p>

                <p>$$
                  \hat{h}_j(t) = \frac{d_{j}(t)}{n(t\mbox{-})}
                  $$</p>

                <p>where $d_{j}(t)$ is the number of deaths due to cause $j$ at time $t$, and $n(t\mbox{-})$ is the
                  number
                  of individuals at risk just prior to $t$.</p>

                <p>With the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survivor function defined in <a
                    href="classical-survival-methods.html#kaplan-meier">part
                    III of this series</a>, $\hat{S}(t)$, the Aalen-Johansen estimator for the cause-specific cumulative
                  incidence function then follows from the equation above:</p>

                <p>$$\hat{F}_j(t) = \sum_{t_k < t} \hat{S}(t_{k-1})\frac{d_{j}(t_k)}{n(t_k\mbox{-})} $$</p>

                    <p>for all times $t_k < t$ where transition events are observed to occur.</p>

                        <h3 id="fine-gray">Fine-Gray proportional hazards model</h3>

                        <p>Analogous to the Cox proportional hazards model described in <a
                            href="classical-survival-methods.html#cox-proportional-hazards">the last post</a>, the
                          Fine-Gray proportional hazards model may be
                          used estimate the hazard of a competing event (termed the sub-distribution hazard) among those
                          yet to experience an event by time $t$. The risk set for the sub-distribution
                          hazard consists of both those who have yet to experience any event, and those who have yet to
                          experience the event of interest, but who have experienced a competing event.</p>

                        <h4 id="sub-distribution-hazard">Sub-distribution hazard</h4>

                        <p>The sub-distribution hazard is therefore defined as the instantaneous risk of experiencing a
                          competing event $j$ given that the individual has not already experienced this
                          event:</p>

                        <p>$$
                          \lambda_j(t)=\lim_{\delta t \downarrow 0}{\left\{\frac{\Pr\left(\left[t \leq T < t + \delta t,
                            C=j \mid (T>t)\right] \cup \left[(T \le t \cap C \neq j)\right]\right)}{\delta t}\right\}}
                            $$</p>

                        <p>where, as before, $C$ is the random variable for the event that occurs.</p>

                        <h4 id="fine-gray-regression">Fine-Gray regression</h4>
                        <p>Fine-Gray regression
                          links
                          the sub-distribution hazard, $\lambda_{j}$, to the cause-specific cumulative incidence
                          function,
                          $F_{j}$, through the relationship</p>

                        <p>$$
                          \lambda_{j}(t) = - \frac{d}{dt} \log{(1-F_{j}(t))}
                          $$</p>

                        <p>As with the Cox proportional hazards model, a proportional hazards regression model is
                          assumed,
                          where the hazard of cause $j$ at time $t$ for individual $i$ is:</p>

                        <p>$$
                          \lambda_{i,j}(t) = \exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\boldsymbol{z}_i)\lambda^{(0)}_{j}(t)
                          $$</p>

                        <p>with $\lambda^{(0)}_{j}(t)$ being the baseline sub-distribution hazard for cause $j$.
                          Covariate
                          coefficients are estimated by maximising the weighted partial likelihood
                          $L(\boldsymbol{\beta})$:</p>

                        <p>$$
                          L(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \prod_{i \in
                          D}\frac{\exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\boldsymbol{z}_{d_i})}{\sum_{j \in
                          R_i}w_{i,j}\exp(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\boldsymbol{z}_j)}
                          $$</p>

                        <p>where $w_{i,j}$ are weights which account for the increasing probability of censoring with
                          increasing follow-up time, $D = \{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n\}$ are the set of distinct failure
                          times,
                          $R_i$ is the set of all individuals who are at risk of failure immediately before time $T_i$,
                          $\boldsymbol{z}_{d_i}$ is the covariate vector for an individual who failed at time $T_i$, and
                          $\boldsymbol{z}_j$
                          is the covariate vector for the $j$th individual at risk at time $T_i$. Covariate effects on
                          the
                          sub-distribution hazard may be interpreted as covariate effects on the
                          cumulative incidence of a competing event.</p>

                        <h3 id="stratification">Stratification</h3>

                        <p>Whilst proportional hazards models are a common method for incorporating covariates in
                          survival
                          analyses, a more straightforward approach is through stratification. In a stratified model the
                          population is subdivided according to covariate group (or strata), the survival is compared
                          within
                          each stratum, and the differences within stratum are combined to give an overall
                          comparison.</p>

                        <p>As stratification allows the baseline hazard to vary across strata it is sometimes used to
                          accommodate non-proportional hazards in Cox and Fine-Gray proportional hazards.
                        </p>
