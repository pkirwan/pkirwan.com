## About {#about}

::: {.about-container}
::: {.about-text}
I'm a Research Associate at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk) in Cambridge. My PhD focussed on [applications of multi-state models to estimate infectious disease burden](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.112581), specifically HIV and COVID-19. My current research involves the development of multi-state "back-calculation" models to estimate HIV incidence and undiagnosed HIV prevalence.

## Statistical methods for survival data {#blog}

This series of blog posts provides an introduction to statistical methods for survival data, with applications for infectious disease modelling and epidemiology. Topics include: classical survival methods, competing risks analysis, and causal inference from observational data.
